	<h1>My introduction(Farida)</h1>
	<p> I am Farida from Karachi, 
	and I recently passed my medical science exams. 
	While that field is incredibly rewarding, 
	I've always been fascinated by the creative problem-solving 
	aspects of web and app development. 
	That's why I'm thrilled to be attending this class offered 
	by Jawan Pakistan. I'm eager to dive into the world of programming 
	languages and design principles, and I know with hard work,
	I can turn my passion into a fulfilling career.
	I can't wait to get started building user-friendly websites 
	and developing innovative apps that make a real impact!
